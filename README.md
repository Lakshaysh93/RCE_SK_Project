## Project Idea
### RCE Projects and profiles page design
**Project idea is to have an interactive and easy to understand profile and project section interface for RCE Saskatchewan as per their requirement. Our focus is on creating a page with dynamic search which will make it easy for the users to find the relevant projects, and also can search for upcoming activities and events organized by the RCE.**

## Project background/Business Opportunity
**The need for improving the section of website:**
- **Better/engaging experience :** The plan is to modify the website's page so that whenever the user visits, they are engaged on the page and have a great experience before leaving the website
- **Search Bar :** There should be a search bar which can make it easy for the user to find the project that they are looking for. 
- **Clarity :** The little focus will also be upon a little more organizing the information so that it is easy to search and better to view everything related to projects and profiles section of the website.
- **Contact information:** the contact us button will redirect users to call or email to person for further information.
- **Applying filter:** the filters can be by the name of the project, year of the project, SDGâ€™s relation, region of the project, targeted community.
